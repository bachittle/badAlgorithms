# Drop Sort

Drop Sort was first theorized in 2006 by David Morgan. Since then its been implemented in many languages and in many ways, from [code golf](https://codegolf.stackexchange.com/questions/61808/lossy-sorting-implement-dropsort) to a [recursive version](http://ibiwan.com/programming/allsorts/in_python/dropsort.py). What makes dropsort unique is that it asks the question "can sorting algorithms be lossy?". The answer of course is yes.
